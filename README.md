# employeedirectory

With this employee directory app, once you start the app, a table of employees will render. 

For a pleasurable user experience, the table will be sorted by catagories, and filtered by certain properties. 

In this directory, employees will be filtered by the following criteria:
-Name
-Phone Number
-Email Address
-Gender
-Age
-Profile Photo

Ideally, this employee directory will allow managers to be able to filer employees while using non sensitive data in order to maximize a businesses employee potential.
